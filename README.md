Newton, Massachusetts Open GIS Data on GitHub

The City of Newton posts its primary GIS data layers to this site. 

These layers are also available for download in Shapefile format on our website at http://www.newtonma.gov/gov/it/gis/online_data_dictionary.asp

Our data is in Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System NAD 83, feet, except those files converted to GeoJSON which are in WGS84. Data is frequently updated. Full documentation is available from our data dictionary - http://www.newtonma.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=75494 If you have any questions, comments or further data requests, please email us at gisinfo@newtonma.gov

GitHub recognizes our GeoJSON files and creates interactive maps using Mapbox for most files. You can also view or download the raw GeoJSON using the 'Raw' button.
